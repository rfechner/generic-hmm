## Biomedical Paper Notes

- Whats core idea of Multi-emission HMMs
    - very few training data and lot of unsupervised data? -> use labeled data as prior, continue training with EM!
    - data augmentation!
    - interpretable
    - generative

- What is the "new" thing to be presented?
    - Multi-emission Hidden Markov Models and a derivation of the update equations generalized to multiple emission signals

- What would be nice to show?
    - Compare the approach to other models
