    "Markov Models and *Hidden* Markov Models are so-called **generative** models. This means that after building them through a process called *training* or *fitting*, we may produce new pseudo-data from our model. We may extrapolate from timepoint $t$ onwards or simulate a new trajectory. We may choose different initial conditions and see, how the model evolves. It is here, i want to make an argument for Hidden Markov Models in the age of Neural Networks. \n",
    "The biggest advantage of HMMs over Neural Methods is in my understanding, that they are **interpretable**. They are white-box models, allowing the observer to clearly understand **why** the model has produced any output. To some degree, the data **is** the model. All important information has been distilled and transformed into a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another big advantage is that they are **simple** models. No-hyperparamter-tuning. No tinkering with the learning rate or swapping out optimizers, adding dropout, adding layer norms, removing layer norms... The process of fitting the model is more sane. In some sense this is a half-truth, as we do have to make assumptions when we choose a model type, however they are very different types of assumptions. They encourage us to think harder about the problem and the setup, not decide on model changes depending on whether or not the $F_1$-Score is moving up or down."

In this example, lets consider the following setup: You're sitting at home, listening to the weather news on the radio. The true weather however is not-observable, as your window blinds are down. In our model, the true weather will be the non-observable (i.e. the *hidden* variable $x_t$) and the news will be the observable variable $y_t$. There are only two different 'true' weather states: Sunny $S$ and Rainy $R$, whereas the media reports three different observations: Dry $D$, Wet $W$ and Cloudy $C$.\n",
